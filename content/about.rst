About the yt Project
====================

This blog covers updates on the `yt Project <http://yt-project.org/>`_.

The yt project aims to produce an integrated science environment for
collaboratively asking and answering astrophysical questions. To do so, it will
encompass the creation of initial conditions, the execution of simulations, and
the detailed exploration and visualization of the resultant data. It will also
provide a standard framework based on physical quantities interoperability
between codes.

Development of yt is driven by a commitment to Open Science principles as
manifested in participatory development, reproducibility, documented and
approachable code, a friendly and helpful community of users and developers,
and Free and Libre Open Source Software.
