Jorge posted this video of using yt inside ParaView.  It demonstrated multi-res
slices, projections, and even volume rendering with an adjustable transfer
function.  I think it's pretty incredible.  Thanks very much to Jorge and
Kitware for their hard work, and it'll be exciting to see where it goes from
here!
