The first yt workshop is in just about a week.  We've updated the `website
<http ://yt-project.org/workshop2012>`_ with the current list of talks, along
with information about getting to and from the workshop from the conference
hotel, and information about how to get the sample data.  Keep your eyes on the
website in the lead up to the workshop, as we'll be posting a script for
fisheye lens renderings for our viz night at the Adler, information about the
talks and example scripts, and other useful info.  Once the workshop is over
we'll update with links to the full videos of the talks, the slides, and
scripts.
