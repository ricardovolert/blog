This is just a brief blog entry -- other news is on the way soon! -- to let
everyone know we've updated our domains.  In keeping with the change in focus
of the yt project, expanding to work with multiple codes and take broader views
of analysis and visualization, we have moved from `enzotools.org
<http://enzotools.org>`_ to `yt-project.org <http://yt-project.org>`_.  Some
other exciting changes will be coming from this in the future, too!
