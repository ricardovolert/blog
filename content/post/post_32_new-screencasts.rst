A few of the yt developers have been experimenting with screencasts to show off
new features or demonstrate how to do some things.  Sam and I have both
prepared screencasts on volume rendering and getting started with developing,
respectively.  Check them out below, and please feel free to leave comments and
let us know what you think -- not just about the screencasts, but about what
they demonstrate, and if you think any of the concepts or routines could be
made easier.
