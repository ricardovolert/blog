yt Development: Quad trees, Tickets and more
============================================

It's been a while since the last Development post &mdash; but in that
time, some pretty fun things have been going on.  These are some of the smaller
things, but there are bigger things in store which I'll write about next
time.

QuadTree Projections
--------------------

For a while, there has been the option to use a QuadTree data structure to
conduct projections through a simulation volume.  This was accessible through
the ``quad_proj`` attribute, which respected the same interface as the normal
``proj`` interface.  The old-style projection code required a spatial
decomposition in parallel, and did not use the most efficient mechanism for
identifying where cells go and which grids overlapped other grids.

The quad tree projection mostly avoided those issues; it could (theoretically)
be parallelized with an arbitrary load- balancing scheme, and it should avoid
having to calculate any overlaps, as they're inherent to the data structure.
However, parallelizing the final combine was never implemented &mdash; so while
it showed good results for scaling in serial, it didn't work in parallel.

However, as of today, it's now parallel!  For big simulations, it should
provide a speedup of between 2 and 10 for projecting.  For the 2.2 release,
this will be the default mechanism for projecting.  If you're reading this,
you're encouraged to check it out by replacing the old-style projection with
the new: pf.h.proj = pf.h.quad_proj

and then conducted any analysis you normally would.  Testing and results for
scaling would be greatly appreciated!

In-Memory Data Format
---------------------

If you have some AMR data that you don't want to write a full plugin or
frontend for, you're now in luck.  One can use the ``Stream`` frontend to
describe a hierarchy, create a data-reader or data-generator, and then feed
this to yt. And example of this can be found `here
<http://matthewturk.bitbucket.org/html/ba3fd37b-842c-4641-b21e-2d3f5268eefe-
stream_proxy-py.html>`_.

The first implementation of this will be for loading data in Paraview and
conducting analysis on this data in yt.

Activation Script
-----------------

We have a new contributor!  `Casey W. Stark <http://thestarkeffect.com/>`_
added in activation scripts to the ``install_script``.  Using these means you
no longer have to set your ``PYTHONPATH`` or ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` or ``PATH``
manually, as you can just source the activate scripts.  Thanks, Casey!

Tickets!  And Bug Reports!
--------------------------

All of the tickets from Trace have been `migrated
<http://hg.enzotools.org/yt/issues>`_ to BitBucket.  All bug reports should be
left there.  Soon the wiki will be moved over, too, and Trac will be
mothballed.

Cameron and I are working on a new bug reporting mechanism that can be run from
the command line -- ``yt bugreport`` -- that should help ensure
triaging of bugs occurs in a timely and meaningful fashion.

That's it for this time.  Happy simulating!
