Tomorrow we're going to try something new -- Google Hangouts! If you'd like
help with something, to share some feedback, or just to say hi to other
community members, stop by Tuesday, May 1st. We'll be starting up around 2PM
Eastern and continuing for a couple hours.

If this works out, we'll try it again from time to time, to catch up on new
developments, help out with scripts or visualization issues, soliciting
feedback, and to chat about using and developing yt.

You'll find the Hangout on the `yt Google Plus page
<https://plus.google.com/107728486871834552760/posts>`_.
