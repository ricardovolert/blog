=============================================================

This last week was the first full week on `BitBucket
<http://hg.enzotools.org/>`_ and so far I think it has been quite successful.
The new development process is for most of the core developers to maintain
personal forks for experimental changes, or longer term changes, and then to
commit directly or merge when bug fixes or features are ready to be integrated.
The list of forks is `easily visible <http://hg.enzotools.org/yt/descendants>`_
and each individual fork's divergence from the primary repository can be viewed
by clicking on the green arrows.  All of the new mechanisms for developing using
BitBucket are included in the '`How to Develop yt
<http://yt.enzotools.org/doc/advanced/developing.html>`_' section of the
documentation.

This last week I spent a few days at KITP's Galaxy Clusters workshop, where I
presented on yt.  There were a few major points that came out of my visit,
talking to the simulators there, that are germane to the long term development
of yt.

  * As time goes on, yt should be increasingly viewed as a mechanism not just
    for analyzing data with its own, internal analysis routines, but as a
    mechanism for handling data, transforming it into a uniform interface
    independent of the underlying simulation code.  This will allow for linking
    against and utilizing external analysis codes much more easily.  (The three
    examples that came up while I was at KITP were a new halo finder, a weak
    lensing code, and a radiation transport code.)  To facilitate the process
    of calling external codes from within yt, I've written a section in the
    documentation `that covers it
    <http://yt.enzotools.org/doc/advanced/external_analysis.html>`_.  
  * There is a great deal of interest in ensuring yt works equally well with
    many different simulation platforms.  This is a primary goal of my current
    fellowship, and I am working toward it.  The next two codes that will be
    targeted for improvement are Gadget and ART, and I made good contacts at
    the workshop to this end.  
    
  * The idea of analysis modules, particularly in a block-programming
    environment, is compelling.  There is quite a bit of interest in an interface
    where inputs and outputs were handled like pipes.  I am still formulating my
    ideas on this.  Last Fall I experimented a bit with an introspection system
    that could handle arguments and could hook up pipes, but it never got very
    far.  (`The code <https://bitbucket.org/MatthewTurk/analysis_plugins/overview>`_.) 

I had a number of scientific takeaways from the meeting, too, but that would
all go into a different blog post.

This week I hope to finish up the adaptive ray tracing.  This past week
StephenS unveiled a halo serialization mechanism, which I Think many people are
excited about, and SamS continued developing his streamline code.
