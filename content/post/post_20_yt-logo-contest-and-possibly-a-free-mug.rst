yt is in need of an awesome new logo, which is why we are announcing the first
ever new logo contest!  So here's the deal: 

We'll accept entries for the next two weeks.  Let's arbitrarily say Tuesday,
May 10th, at 11:59:59 pm EST.   If there is more than one entry, we will put it
up for a community vote at that time.   

Oh, and the most important part -- the winner will get a coffee mug with their
new logo front and center!!!

Please email yt@enzotools.org with your image attached. Good luck, and happy
logo-ing! 

Sam
