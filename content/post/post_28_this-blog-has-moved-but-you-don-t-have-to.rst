This blog has moved -- but you don't have to!

In keeping with the `project rename
<http://blog.yt-project.org/were-now-the-yt- project>`_ we've moved this blog
from it's old home at `blog.enzotools.org <http://blog.enzotools.org>`_ to its
new home at `blog.yt-project.org <http://blog.yt-project.org>`_.  But, we've
put in a few redirects, and the RSS feed hasn't moved, so you shouldn't need to
do anything different to get here.  We've also enabled anonymous commenting, so
feel free to comment below.  (But, of course, letting us know who you are would
certainly help with keeping in touch!)
