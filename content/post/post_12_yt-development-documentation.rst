yt development: Documentation
=============================

As a result of progress in my scientific goals, and the application of recent
yt developments to them, I did not make many changes or developments in yt this
week. When I did work on yt, I primarily spent time re-organizing the
`documentation <http://yt.enzotools.org/doc/>`_ and fixing several errors. I
have added an "installation" section, consolidated a few sections, and wrote
two new sections on how to make plots and on how to generate derived data
products.  I think that the documentation is now much easier to navigate and
follow.

This week I also fine-tuned the API for the bridge that connects Enzo
and Python, relying on feedback from other Enzo developments. This work is the
first step in creating a generalized library for constructing initial
conditions; it is not meant to be Enzo-specific.  I will report more on this,
but the ultimate goal is to be able to construct initial conditions using
scripts, rather than constructing multiple C routines. This should make
scientific experimentation much more accessible.

One final note is that this last week saw the first successful execution of a
large-scale Enzo simulation with inline analysis provided by yt, using the
`EnzoStaticOutputInMemory` object. BrittonS is driving that simulation forward,
and he's also conducting benchmarks to see how expensive inline analysis is.
