The yt workshop last week in Chicago ( http://yt-project.org/workshop2012/ ) was an
enormous success. On behalf of the organizing and technical committees,
I'd like to specifically thank the FLASH Center, particularly Don Lamb,
Mila Kuntu, Carrie Eder, for their hospitality; the venue was outstanding
and their hospitality touching. Additionally, we're very grateful to 
the Adler Planetarium's Doug Roberts and Mark SubbaRao for hosting us on
Wednesday evening -- seeing the planetarium show as well as volume 
renderings made by yt users up on the dome was so much fun. The yt
workshop was supported by NSF Grant 1214147. Thanks to everyone who
attended -- your energy and excitement helped make it a success. 

Thanks also to the organizing and technical committees: Britton Smith, John
ZuHone, Brian O'Shea, Jeff Oishi, Stephen Skory, Sam Skillman, and Cameron
Hummels. All talks have been recorded, and you can clone a unified repository
of talk slides and worked examples:

A few photos have been put up online, too: http://goo.gl/g02uP

As I am able to edit and upload talks, they'll appear on the yt youtube channel
as well as on the yt homepage: http://www.youtube.com/ytanalysis

Thanks again, and wow, what a week!
