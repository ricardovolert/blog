yt development: HEALpix and Contour Tree
========================================

This week there was not very much yt development.  However, a few notes may be
of interest.  SamS has updated the HEALPix camera to support ordered
projections; what this means is that you can now make volume renderings using a
standard color transfer function, or even the Planck transfer function, that
cover 4pi of the sky.  I am still working on integrating a method for creating
images easily, but for now the scripts from `last week
<http://blog.enzotools.org/yt-development-all-sky-column-density-calcula>`_
should work.

I worked a bit on improving the speed of the contour tree, but I am growing to
suspect that a full new algorithm will have to be implemented.  I have
researching this, and I believe that the best method will require a 'union
merge' data structure.  Hopefully I will have something to report on this
shortly.  As of now, the contouring algorithm should be a factor of 10%-50%
faster than it was a week ago, depending on the dataset characteristics. <br
/>The idea of selection of astrophysical objects, rather than geometric
objects, has been on my mind lately, and I committed a first pass at an API for
this sort of selection.  I hope to have more information about that in the near
future, but I anticipate those development efforts to ramp up around the end of
March.
