yt Version 2.3 Announcement
===========================

.. author: Stephen Skory

.. date: 1323967440.0

Just in time for the New Year, we’re happy to announce the release of yt
version 2.3!  ( http://yt-project.org/ )  The new version includes many new
modules and enhancements, and the usual set of bug fixes over the last point
release. We encourage all users to upgrade to take advantage of the changes.

yt is a community-developed analysis and visualization toolkit for
astrophysical simulation data. yt provides full support for Enzo, Orion, Nyx,
and FLASH codes, with preliminary support for the RAMSES code (and a handful of
others.)  It can be used to create many common types of data products, as well
as serving as a library for developing your own data reductions and processes.

Below is a non-comprehensive list of new features and enhancements:

   * Improved and expanded documentation located at http://yt-project.org/doc/
   * Boolean logic data containers (joins, intersections and nots) to select
     arbitrary data regions.
   * Multi-level parallelism for subgroups of MPI tasks.
   * Extensive answer tests.
   * Isocontouring and flux-over-surface calculations, with WebGL interface.
   * A reorganized field system.
   * Adaptive resolution HEALpix-based all-sky volume rendering.
   * Radial column density calculations.
   * Memory usage, performance enhancements and bug fixes throughout the code.
 

Everything, from installation, to development, to a cookbook, can be found on
the homepage: http://yt-project.org/

We have updated the libraries installed with the install script; for more
information, see the “Dependencies” section of the yt docs at
http://yt-project.org/doc/advanced/installing.html.

Development has been sponsored by the NSF, DOE, and various University funding.
We invite you to get involved with developing and using yt!

We’re also holding the FIRST YT WORKSHOP from January 24-26 at the FLASH center
in Chicago.  See the workshop homepage for more information!

Please forward this announcement to interested parties.

Sincerely,

The yt development team
