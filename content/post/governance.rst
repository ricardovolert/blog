Much Ado About Governance
=========================

This blog post is long overdue!  (And I can't believe it's been so long since
we had a blog post here, either.)  Over the last few months, particularly after
the release of yt 3.0, on the yt-dev mailing list we've had discussions about
how to institute some form of governance of the project.  This has been one of
the hardest transitions yt has had to make -- it used to be that we could fit
everybody who had a stake in it into a small office, but that's no longer the
case.

Over the course of several long email threads, as well as discussions in the
comments for `pull request 40
<https://bitbucket.org/yt_analysis/ytep/pull-request/40/ytep-1776-team-infrastructure>`_
to the YTEP repository, Britton Smith developed `YTEP-1776
<https://ytep.readthedocs.org/en/latest/YTEPs/YTEP-1776.html>`_.

This establishes a framework for a few things:

 * Decision making -- particularly when there are conflicts between individuals
   about how to proceed with code changes, with release information, and the
   like.
 * Identification of individuals as "`project members
   <http://yt-project.org/members.html>`_," which is not only useful for
   participation in decision making, but also for placing on a CV, which is
   especially useful for younger researchers.
 * Establish liaisons between platforms and codes and yt
 * Establish mechanisms for regular checkins and meetings to discuss goings-on
 * Develop standards and processes for code review

One of the original goals of the governance discussion was to attempt to ensure
that individuals who had contributed to yt, and who might otherwise *not* get
recognition for their efforts (be they in code or time spent helping others)
would be able to be recognized in some sort of semi-official way.

I'm so proud of everyone in the community for putting this together.  I think
that this is a delicate transition, and everyone has been incredible during it
-- especially Britton Smith, who essentially drove the entire discussion.
