yt has moved to mercurial!
==========================

For about a year and a half now, most of the unstable development of yt has
occurred inside a `mercurial <http://mercurial.selenic.com/>`_ repo.  Mercurial
is a distributed version control system, not unlike git or bzr, where each
checkout brings with it the entire history of the repository and enables full
development.  Each individual can commit changes to their own repository, while
still accepting changes from others.  It also makes it much easier to submit
patches upstream.

All in all, mercurial is a much better development
environment than subversion, and I think that's been born out by the changes in
the development style of both yt and Enzo, which has also recently moved to
mercurial. 

For a while we'd been keeping a mixed model: subversion was
regarded as more stable, slower moving, and the mercurial development was less
stable and faster; things were worked on in hg and then backported to svn.
However, because of the recent reorganization efforts to clean up the code in
preparation for yt-2.0, it became clear that backporting these changes to svn
would be a nightmare.  So we decided we would move exclusively to hg for
development. 

However, this brought with it some unfortunate problems: when I
initially created the hg repository in February of 2009, I only imported from
SVN revisions 1100 onwards.  And because of the way hg works, I was unable to
get any newly reimported history to connect with the old history.  But, if we
were going to move to hg exclusively, I wanted all that old history. 

But,
thanks to the `convert extension
<http://mercurial.selenic.com/wiki/ConvertExtension>`_ to mercurial, I was able
to import all the old history and splice the two together.  But, unfortunately,
this meant that all the changeset hashes were different!  So with the conversion
to mercurial we had to force everyone who already had an hg repo to re-clone and
re-initialize their own repository.  This turned out not to be so bad, but
because of some decisions I made during the splicing the graph now looks a bit
crazy in the middle!  I'm still thinking about ways to change that without
changing any changeset hashes, but we'll just have to see; maybe it's not so bad
that we have so many crazy paths and branches. 

We're gently migrating to the
hg repositories exclusively; the installation scripts have mostly been updated,
but not completely rolled out.  Hopefully the end result will be worth it --
I've written up some developer documentation on how to use hg and how to use it
`to develop yt <http://yt.enzotools.org/browser/doc/how_to_develop_yt.txt>`_,
and I hope this will be the start of a more open development process!
